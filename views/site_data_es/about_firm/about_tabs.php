<p>In 1996, Charles P. Romaker founded The Romaker Law Firm. At first, the firm had only Charles as its attorney, one secretary, and was located in a small office in downtown Chicago. Later, in 1997, The Romaker Law Firm merged with another firm to form a partnership, Manchik & Romaker, which lasted for about ten years. Throughout this time, the firm exclusively represented plaintiffs from all walks of life in worker's compensation and personal injury matters.</p>

<p>In September 2006, Charles re-initiated The Romaker Law Firm with one associate attorney and two legal assistants. By June of 2007, the firm had moved to a medium-sized office and now had two associate attorneys as well as four legal assistants. The firm's client base also began to grow exponentially as the firm maintained its focus on the vigorous advocacy of plaintiffs in worker's compensation and personal injury matters.</p>

<p>In May of 2012, after several years of success and growth, The Romaker Law Firm moved to a larger space: 211 W. Wacker Drive, Suite 1450, the firm's current location. Since that time, the firm has continued to rapidly grow, adding additional associate attorneys and staff, and even expanding into the area of employment law. As a result, The Romaker Law Firm holds a unique position in the current legal market. Indeed, no other law firm in Chicago exclusively represents as many English and Spanish-speaking individuals in worker's compensation, personal injury, and employment matters as The Romaker Law Firm.</p>
