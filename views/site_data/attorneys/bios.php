<h2>Summary</h2>
<h4>Tod Allswang practices in the areas of personal injury and workers' compensation law. Mr. Allswang has only represented the injured person since he has been in practice. Throughout those years, he has secured millions of dollars for his clients. In addition to obtaining his clients' cash awards, Mr. Allswang knows how important it is to make sure his clients receive their weekly benefits in a timely manner and that their medical care is approved.</h4>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<h4>Mr. Allswang has experience in personal injury matters from a simple rear-end car accident to a catastrophic wrongful death suit against one of the biggest national railroad lines.  He has handled thousands of workersâ€™ compensation claims as simple as a finger injury to claims involving permanent total disability.</h4>
<h4>He takes great pride in advocating for workers' treated unfairly and denied their benefits because of fabricated defenses.  In one such case, Mr. Allswang obtained a decision that included an award of penalties and attorney fees in excess of $150,000.00, when a union tuck pointer fell from a scaffold.  The employer took the position that the accident never happened.  In a similar type of case, Mr. Allswang, was also awarded penalties and fees when an undocumented worker, who was paid in cash,   amputated three fingers while using a table saw.  In that case, the employer went so far as to deny that the individual even worked for the construction company.  Mr. Allswang secured for that client: the payment of all his lost time from work, the payment of all his medical, an award for his injuries, and an award of penalties.</h4>

<h2>Background</h2>
<h4>Mr. Allswang was raised by a single mother who managed to raise two children and keep a house serving food and drinks.  Mr. Allswang worked as a laborer from the age of 16 to 24.  Those past experiences aid in his current practice as he knows how precarious financial stability can be and how important it is to secure his clients benefits as quickly as the legal system will allow.</h4>
